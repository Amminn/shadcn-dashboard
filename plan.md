in my case now i',@tanstack/react-table" and i have a large data which is displayed in a table, the thing is in one of the colums i have status, and this status it can be failed | pending | success 
so what i'm trying to build is a sort feature so when i click on the status header, at first it should should sort the data with success first, and then if i click again it should sort with pending and if i click again it should sort with failed first

tell if this is doable using tanstack react-table
